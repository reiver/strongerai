		<p class="f f-s">
			<b>S</b>tronger <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> is a book on creating human-like (or for a looser definition, mammal-like) intelligence <em><abbr title="performed on computer or via computer simulation">in silico</abbr></em>.
			I.e., a book on creating <em>strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>.
			In addition to the name <em>strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>,
			this topic also goes by the names:
			<em>artificial general intelligence</em> (<em><abbr title="Artificial General Intelligence">AGI</abbr></em>)
			and
			<a href="http://changelog.ca/quote/2012/11/04/cognitive_ai_engineering_ai"><em>cognitive <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em></a>.
			Only a background in software engineering and an interest in <em>strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> are necessary to read this book.
		</p>
		<p>
			You won't become an expert <em>just</em> by reading this book.
			But, to invoke an idiom: "you have to walk before you can run".
			This book will help you get started.
			By reading this book, you will learn the basics and get an idea of what else you need to learn (beyond this book) to advance your knowledge of the topic.
		</p>

		<p>
			I created this book due to three motivations:
			#1 that I had the inclination to write it,
			#2 that there seemed to be no books that introduced someone with only a software engineering background to the topic
			and
			#3 to help organize some of my thoughts on the topic.
			And I suppose #4, because I have a high interest in the topic.
			Frankly I think there are others more qualified to write this book than I.
			But as far as I can tell, none of them have written a book like this; so I have.
			Perhaps someone out there will find it useful or helpful in some way.
			Although, if the <a href="http://changelog.ca/quote/2012/08/17/while_we_teach_we_learn">protégé effect</a> is real, then I will have benefitted from writing it.
		</p>

		<p>
			The format of the book is that there are "<em>normal</em>" chapters that talk about a topic
			and there are "<em>hands-on</em>" chapters where you "roll-up-your-sleeves" and learn how to implement the things that have been discussed.
			If you so choose, you can skip the "<em>hands-on</em>" chapters, and only read the "<em>normal</em>" chapters to get an overview of the topic.
