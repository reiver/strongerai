			<b>S</b>tronger <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> is a book on creating human-like (or for a looser definition mammal-like) intelligence <em><abbr title="performed on computer or via computer simulation">in silico</abbr></em>.
			I.e., a book on creating <em>strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>.
			In addition to name <em>strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>,
			this topic also goes by the names:
			<em>artificial general intelligence</em> (<em><abbr title="Artificial General Intelligence">AGI</abbr></em>)
			and
			<em>cognitive <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>.
			Only a background in software engineering and an interest in <em>strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> are necessary to read this book.
		</p>

		<p>
			The author created this book due to three motivations:
			#1 that the author had the inclination to write it,
			#2 that there seemed to be no books that introduced someone with only a software engineering background to the topic
			and
			#3 to help organize his views on topic.
