		<h1><br />Self-Organizing Maps</h1>


		<p class="f f-s">
			<b>S</b>elf-organizing maps appear in a number of places in the brain.
			The <em>primary visual cortex</em> also called <em>V1</em> is a famous example of where <em>self-organizing maps</em> are involved in edge-detection.
			We also see these well organized maps involved with <em>sensory information</em>, with taste maps in the gustatory cortex, in somatotopic maps in the primary somatosensory cortex, etc.
		<p>
		</p>
			So if our approach to creating <em>strong <abbr title="Artificial General Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> is to create an <em>artificial brain</em> (and let an <em>artificial mind</em> emerge), then understanding how <em>self-organizing maps</em> work can be important.
