		<h1><br />Modeling</h1>


		<p class="f f-w">
			<b>W</b>hen you model something, you are leave out details.
			You make a perhaps implicit decision that some parts of the real system aren't important and some are. (The important parts being what you model; and the unimportant parts being left out of your model.) 
		</p>
		<p>
			Brains are made of atoms; atoms are made of protons, electrons, and neutrons; protons and neutrons are made of quarks.
		</p>
		<p>
			Do we model all this?
			(Should we model and brain, and have our model of the brain be at the quark level, taking into account things such as quantum mechanics?)
			Or is the essence of our system more easily and more usefully represented with higher level constructs?
