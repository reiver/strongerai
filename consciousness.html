		<h1><br />Consciousness</h1>


		<p class="f f-i">
			<b>I</b> was at a friends house one evening, late at night, watching a movie.
			My eyes were starting to close.
			I was tired before I started watching the movies, but I watched the movie with the friend anyways.
			At about half way in the movie, my eyes closed and I feel asleep.
			After what <em>felt</em> like a few seconds later, I opened my eyes.
			It had been much more than a few seconds!
			The movies was over.
			Almost an hour in time had past.
		</p>
		<p>
			The thing is, sometimes when I fall asleep, I have a sense of how much time has past when I wake up.
		</p>
		<p>
			This time though, it felt like I had only been asleep for a few seconds.
			It was a bit of an unsettling experience for me.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was unconsciousness during that sleep.
		</p>
		<p>
			But where is consciousness in the brain?
			Is there an algorithm for consciousness?
			If we wanted to create an artificial brain, what brain structure would we need to (re)create to have our artificial brain be consciousness?
			Is consciousness even contained is a single brain structure?
			Does consciousness only make sense if the brain is part of a body like ours?
			Is consciousness emergent?
			Does consciousness require exposure to an environment, like vision?
		</p>
		<p>
			(I don't actually know the answers to those questions.)

		<p>
			There are roughly <a href="http://changelog.ca/quote/2012/04/06/two_main_types_of_consciousness_research">2 main types of consciousness research</a>.
			In the paper "Returning from Oblivion: Imaging the Neural Core of Consciousness", these 2 categories of consciousness research as described as follows:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Consciousness research can roughly be divided into two categories:
				(1) studies on the contents of consciousness and
				(2) studies on consciousness as a state (Dehaene and Changeux, 2011).
				Whereas theories on the particular contents of consciousness, such as visual consciousness, argue for the importance of cortical structures (Lamme, 2006), theories focusing on consciousness as a state stress the importance of subcortical (Baars, 1995; Fuller et al., 2011) or thalamocortical structures (Tononi, 2004; Merker, 2007).
