		<p class="f f-d">
			<b>D</b>id you know that the <em>brain</em> was not always seen as the place the <em>mind</em> was located&#8253;
			Today, it is part of common knowledge that the <em>mind</em> is in the <em>brain</em>.
			But in the past it was believed that the <em>mind</em> was in the <em>heart</em>!
		</p>
		<p>
			This mind-heart view still survives in idioms such as "<em>a change of heart</em>", "<em>know it by heart</em>", and "<em>half-hearted</em>".
		</p>
		<p>
			An ancient fable, attributed to Aesop, known as "the deer without a heart" or "the ass without a heart", also preserves this view.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the ancient Egyptians prepared a body for mummification, the brain was removed because it was beleived that the heart of the seat of intelligence.

			There seems to be 2 main approaches with <em>strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first approach, with <em>strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>, is to try to create an artificial mind.
		</p>
		<p>
			The second approach, with <em>strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>, is to try to create an artificial brain.
		</p>
		<p>
			The former view seems to be the mainstream view.
			The latter view is what, as an approach, I suspect has a better chance of creating <em>strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>.
