		<h1>General Intelligence</h1>


		<p class="f f-a">
			<b>A</b>n alternate name for <em>strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> is:
			<em>artificial general intelligence</em> (<em><abbr title="Artificial General Intelligence">AGI</abbr></em>).
			Although I have not looked into the hisory of how this name came into use, my suspicion is that it derives from the concept of <em>general intelligence</em> in humans.
			The concept of <a href="http://changelog.ca/quote/2011/12/20/discovery_of_general_intelligence"><em>general intelligence</em> was discovered</a> statisically by looking at people's results on various intelligence tests.
			This statistical result suggested, to some at least, that <em>in a nutshell</em> there is <em>something</em> general and generic that drives human intelligence.
			The more a person has of this <em>something</em> (whatever it is), the more intelligent that person is likely to be;
			the less a person has of this <em>something</em>, the less intelligent that person is likely to be.
		</p>
		<p>
			What this <em>something</em> is is a matter of debate and research.
			There is even disagreement of whether it exists, as something "real", or not.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although, from certain points of view, a more important question is whether this concept is useful or not.
		</p>
		<p><strong>
			Although, for the purposes of this book, we care about this in that it may help us create <em>strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>s</em>.
		</strong></p>
		<p>
			But before we get too far ahead of ourselves, let's go over some of the basics.
		</p>


		<h2 id="one">1. Tests</h2>
		<p>
			You take a test you get a score.
			That is (part of) the reality I grew up with when I was in school.
			I did a lot of this test taking in elementary school, high school and university.
		</p>
		<p>
			I tended to do better at some tests than others.
			With math tests, I tended to do extremely well.
			(It was not uncommon for me to get a perfect score on a math test.)
			English tests I didn't do as well at.
			(Although, with English, it varied from year to year.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Back when I was still in university, it was a requirement that I take an English-elective.
			(I.e., I had to take one of the available English-classes.)
			Actually, over the years I was in university, I was required to take a number of English-electives.
			My choice of what English-class to take that semester at university had to do with what fit in my schedule.
			At the time, the only thing that fit my schedule (with the other classes I wanted to take) was a poetry class.
			I don't think anyone who knows me <em>in real life</em> would consider me a natural poet.
			Yet poetry is what I took.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although, thinking about it a bit, I think one thing that made me somewhat open to taking this poetry class was that in one of my English-classes in high school, one of the instructors thought a poem I wrote, for a class assignment, was "good".
		</p>
		<p>
			There is one memory that sticks out in my mind about that university poetry class.
			It is probably because I have told this story a number of times.
		</p>
		<p>
			In that poetry class, we read a poem in-class and then divided into groups and discussed the poem with the others in our groups.
			After this group discussions, we were given a test by the instructor.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is one of the questions the instructor asked on the test:
			"what color do you feel?".
			She was asking "what color I felt" in reaction to a reading a section of the poem.
			Now, as I've been told, some people associate colors with emotions.
			(Perhaps you are one of them.)
			I don't know if this is something these people are born with or something they pick up through socialization.
			Either way, at that time I was not aware of this color-emotion association.
			When the instructor asked me that question on the test, I couldnt answer it in the way she wanted.
			The question was nonsensical to me.
			I received a poor score on that test.
			Eventually I learned the emotion to color mapping she expected and was able to give her the answer she wanted; and got a better score on her tests.
		</p>
		<p>
			There were other English classes I took.
			There were even English-classes where I even got an <em>A</em>.
			This was not common though.
			I was never a virtuoso with any of the topics or skills that fall under the umbrella of <em>English</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			My brother, on the other hand, is.
			He is gifted at story writing.
			He effortlessly creates text messages, in jest, that sound like something out of a professionally written novel.
		</p>
		<p>
			I point this out because I want to stress that (I do not think) it is not through fault of the English instructors that prevented me from attaining the skill of a master poet or master novelist.
			I did find fault with some of these instructors, in certain respects.
			However, I do not think any kind of <em>instructor fault</em> was holding me back in English.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I took calculus in university, I sat in the front row of the class.
			(Something I did with a lot of my university classes.)
			As the instructor of the class lectured about calculus in front of the students, I was drawing in the margin of my notebook (instead of taking notes).
		</p>
		<p>			
			The class was long, so there was a short break in the middle of the class.
			Some people took that opportunity to use the washroom,
			some went and grab a snack,
			while others went and <em>stretched their legs</em> or <em>got some fresh air</em>.
			I came back a little early from the break, and only the instructor and I were in the class room.
			While I was gone, the instructor had a chance to glance at the notebook I left on my desk.
			Having sat in the front row, the pages of my still open notebook was easy for him to see.
			There were (virtually) no notes in my notebook on the calculus lecture that he just gave.
			There were only doodles -- only drawings.
			He made a comment to me that was something to the effect of "nice notes".
			His comment was unexpected and I clumsily tried to justify my lack of note-taking.
			He then grinned and said something to the effect of, "it's OK, math isn't for everyone".
		</p>
		<p>
			The thing is, I actually like(d) math.
			And (unknown to the math instructor at the time) I tended to do very well on math tests.
			Math tended to be my favorite class.
		</p>
		<p>
			I just did not see a need for me to take notes in that first-year calculus class.
			My lack of note taking was because I thought the material being taught was <em>straight forward</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the class progressed and I took test after test, I got perfect or near perfect scores on his calculus tests.
			His view of my math abilities also changed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most of my childhood was spent in the Vancouver area.
			(Vancouver is a city on the west-coast of North America.)
			However, I lived in the Dallas area a couple times.
			(Dallas is city in the south of North America.)
		</p>
		<p>
			The second time I lived in the Dallas area I was turning into a teenager.
			At this time, I met the minimum requirements to enroll the the high school class called <em>athletics</em>.
			<em>Athletics</em> was the class you went into if you wanted to be on the football team, basketball team, weight lifting team, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			There were tests in this class too.
			You were tested on how far you could do a horizontal jump.
			You were tested on how many chin-ups you could do.
			You were tested on how much you could curl.
		</p>
		<p>
			I had a pretty strong curl at the age of 13.
		</p>
		<p>
			But what is the point of all these tests?
		</p>
		<p>
			Todo...
		</p>


		<h2 id="two">2. Intelligence Tests</h2>
		<p>
			Is there a way to predict (with some degree of certainty) how well a person will do in a class <em>before</em> they take the class?
			... Todo...
		</p>
		<p>
			Todo...
		</p>


		<h2 id="three">3. IQ</h2>
		<p>
			When people talk about intelligence, the label <em>IQ</em> is often used.
			The first thing to be cognizant about is that what <em>IQ</em> used to mean and what <em>IQ</em> means today are not the same.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>IQ</em> is an initialization for <em>intelligence quotient</em>.
			The keyword there being: <em>quotient</em>.
			The word <em>quotient</em> implies that there is some kind of mathematical <em>division</em> going on with <em>IQ</em>.
			This quotient is what people used to refer when they said <em>IQ</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			But today this is no longer the case;
			<a href="http://changelog.ca/quote/2012/09/21/iq_no_longer_a_quotient">IQ is not longer a quotient</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>IQ</em>, as it is used today, is just <em>any</em> result you get from <em>any</em> intelligence test, regarless of whether it is a quotient or not.
			(The term <em>IQ</em> just seems easier to say, and already has widespread conflation with <em>intelligence</em>.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Said another way, <em>IQ</em> use to be the name of the score you got from an specific type of intelligence test.
			(The score you got from other intelligence tests were not called <em>IQ</em>s.)
			Now, however, <em>IQ</em> is used for the score you get from <em>any</em> intelligence test.
			Also, another tendency is that <em>all</em> intelligence tests tend to be called: <em>IQ tests</em>.
		</p>


		<h2 id="four">4. Many IQs, Not One IQ</h2>
		<p>
			Even when a person takes the same intelligence test, that person can get a different score.
			<q><a href="http://changelog.ca/quote/2012/08/14/changing_iq">Change the examiner, the day of the test, the person's mood, or the examiner's alertness, and you change the IQ</a></q>
			So, does it makes sense to talk about a person's IQ as if it is a single never changing number?
		</p>
		<p>
			There are also different intelligence tests.
			A score of 174 on one intelligence test is not the same as a score of 174 on another intelligence test.
			An IQ score is meaningless if you do not specify which intelligence test it was scored against.
		</p>
		<p>
			(But are all these different IQ scores, on the same and different tests, related at all?
			The concept of <em>general intelligence</em> suggests they are. But more on that later.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Something to note though, don't take any of this talk of <em>many IQs</em> as an argument that IQ is meaningless.
			My impression is that it seems to represent something "real".
			However, things can be a bit complex and messy when you take a closer look.
