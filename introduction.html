		<p class="f f-t">
			<b>T</b>he original goal of <em>artificial intelligence</em> (<em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>) was to create <strong>human-like intelligence</strong> <em><abbr title="performed on computer or via computer simulation">in silico</abbr></em>.
			Modern <em><abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr></em>, while useful and instances of (real) intelligence, are (for the most part) nothing like human intelligence.
		</p>
		<p>
			Given that the <em>AI</em> label has come to cover much more than just human-like intelligence,
			this goal, of creating <em>human-like intelligence in silico</em>, has been given a new label and is now called <strong>strong AI</strong> (thus the title of this book),
			but also goes by the names <strong>artificial general intelligence</strong> (<strong>AGI</strong>) and <strong>cognitive AI</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			(Although some seem to using the label <em>machine learning</em> for non-human-like <em><abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr></em>.)
