		<h1><br />Introduction</h1>


		<p class="f f-t">
			<b>T</b>he original goal of <em>artificial intelligence</em> (<em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>) was to create <strong>human-like intelligence</strong> <em><abbr title="performed on computer or via computer simulation">in silico</abbr></em>.
			Modern <em><abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr></em>, while useful and instances of (real) intelligence, are (for the most part) nothing like human intelligence.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite this broadening of the definition of <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>, there are still some people who have tried to reserve the name <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> for artificial forms of human-like intelligence.
			But I think it is too late for that.
			Today the name <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> is used as a name for a lot of non-human-like artificial intelligences.
		</p>
		<p>
			Examples of non-human-like artificial intelligences that get called <em><abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr></em> include:
			support vector machines (<abbr title="Support Vector Machine">SVM</abbr>s),
			k-mediods,
			decision trees,
			cascade-correlation,
			echo state networks,
			and many many others.
		</p>
		<p>
			In contrast, the type of <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> you tend to see and read in science-fiction movies and literature is often human-like.
			For example, the fictional character <em>Data</em> from the TV series <em>Star Trek</em>,
			the fictional character <em>Sonny</em> from the movie <em>I, Robot</em>,
			the fictional characters <em>Agent Smith</em>, <em>Agent Brown</em> &amp; <em>Agent Jones</em> from the movie <em>The Matrix</em>
			were all fictional examples of human-like <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Non-human-like <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>s have daily use in industry.
			The type of <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>, in online advertising technology, which decides what is the "best" ad to show someone, is not human-like.
			The type of <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> that you find in video games is not human-like.
			The type of <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> that powers SPAM filters is not human-like.
		</p>
		<p>
			And if you study <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> in school, that type of <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> will (almost certainly) not be human-like.
		</p>
		<p>
			The interest of this book is artificial human-like intelligence.
			Some call this <em>strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>,
			others call this <em>artificial general intelligence</em> (<abbr title="Artificial General Intelligence">AGI</abbr>),
			while others call it <em>cognitive <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The title of this book "<em>Stronger AI</em>" is a play on one of those names: <em>strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>.
