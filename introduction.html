		<h1><br />Introduction</h1>


		<p class="f f-t">
			<b>T</b>he original goal of <em>artificial intelligence</em> (<em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>) was to create <strong>human-like intelligence</strong> <em><abbr title="performed on computer or via computer simulation">in silico</abbr></em>.
			Modern <em><abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr></em>, while useful and instances of (real) intelligence, are (for the most part) nothing like human intelligence.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite this broadening of the definition of <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>, there are still some people who have tried to reserve the name <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> for artificial forms of human-like intelligence.
			But I think it is too late for that.
			Today the name <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> is used as a name for a lot of non-human-like artificial intelligences.
		</p>
		<p>
			Examples of non-human-like artificial intelligences that get called <em><abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr></em> include:
			support vector machines (<abbr title="Support Vector Machine">SVM</abbr>s),
			k-mediods,
			decision trees,
			cascade-correlation,
			echo state networks,
			and many many others.
		</p>
		<p>
			In contrast, the type of <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> you tend to see and read in science-fiction movies and literature is often human-like.
			For example, the fictional character <em>Data</em> from the TV series <em>Star Trek</em>,
			the fictional character <em>Sonny</em> from the movie <em>I, Robot</em>,
			the fictional characters <em>Agent Smith</em>, <em>Agent Brown</em> &amp; <em>Agent Jones</em> from the movie <em>The Matrix</em>
			were all fictional examples of human-like <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Non-human-like <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>s have daily use in industry.
			The type of <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>, in online advertising technology, which decides what is the "best" ad to show someone is not human-like.
			The type of <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> that you find in video games is not human-like.
			The type of <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> that powers SPAM filters is not human-like.
		</p>
		<p>
			And if you study <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> in school, that type of <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> will (almost certainly) not be human-like.
		</p>
		<p>
			The interest of this book is artificial human-like intelligence.
			Some call this <em>strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>,
			others call this <em>Artificial General Intelligence</em> (<abbr title="Artificial General Intelligence">AGI</abbr>),
			while others call it <em>cognitive <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>.
		</p>


		<h2 id="one">1. Strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></h2>
		<p>
			Given that the <em>AI</em> label has come to cover much more than just human-like intelligence,
			the goal of creating <em>human-like intelligence in silico</em> has been given a new name.
			That name is: <strong>strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></strong>.
			(Thus the title of this book; which is a play on that name.)
			And all the non-human-like intelligence has been given the <em>weak <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The idea is that you can divide modern <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> into <em>strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> and <em>weak <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>.
			Although some might argue that, although there are differences, that there is not clear separation between the two.
		</p>


		<h2 id="two">2. Artificial General Intelligence (<abbr title="Artificial General Intelligence">AGI</abbr>)</h2>
		<p>
			Another name of human-like <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> is: <strong>artificial general intelligence</strong> (<strong><abbr title="Artificial General Intelligence">AGI</abbr></strong>).
			My guess is that this name derives from the concept of <em>general intelligence</em> in humans.
		</p>
		<p>
			I discuss <em>general intelligence</em> in: <a href="g.html">chapter 6. general intelligence</a>.
		</p>

		<h2 id="three">3. Cognitive <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></h2>
		<p>
			Yet another name for human-like <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> is: <strong>cognitive AI</strong>.

		<h2 id="four">4. Machine Learning</h2>
		<p>
			Todo...
		</p>


		<h2 id="five">5. Why All The Names?</h2>
		<p>
			You might be wondering why I'm spending time listing out all these names.
			The reason is that, after or perhaps even while you are reading this book, you may want to do some further research.
			Knowing these various different names will give you some <em>keyword phrases</em> to search on.
