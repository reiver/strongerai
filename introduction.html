		<h1><br />Introduction</h1>


		<p class="f f-t">
			<b>T</b>he original goal of <em>artificial intelligence</em> (<em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>) was to create <strong>human-like intelligence</strong> <em><abbr title="performed on computer or via computer simulation">in silico</abbr></em>.
			Modern <em><abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr></em>, while useful and instances of (real) intelligence, are (for the most part) nothing like human intelligence.
		</p>
		<p>
			The type of <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> you tend to see and read in science-fiction movies and literature is often human-like.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, the type of <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>, in online advertising technology, which decides what is the "best" ad to show someone is not human-like.
			The type of <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> that you find in video games is not human-like.
			The type of <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> that powers SPAM filters is not human-like.
		</p>
		<p>
			The type of <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> you are going to learn if you study <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> in school is (almost certainly) not going to be human-like.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, the topic of this book <em>is</em> (mainly) human-like <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>.
		</p>


		<h2 id="one">1. Strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></h2>
		<p>
			Given that the <em>AI</em> label has come to cover much more than just human-like intelligence,
			the goal of creating <em>human-like intelligence in silico</em> has been given a new name.
			That name is: <strong>strong AI</strong>.
			(Thus the title of this book; which is a play on that name.)
			And all the non-human-like intelligence has been given the <em>weak <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The idea is that you can divide modern <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> into <em>strong <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> and <em>weak <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em>.
			Although some might argue that, although there are differences, that there is not clear separation between the two.
		</p>


		<h2 id="two">2. Artificial General Intelligence (<abbr title="Artificial General Intelligence">AGI</abbr>)</h2>
		<p>
			Another name of human-like <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> is: <strong>artificial general intelligence</strong> (<strong><abbr title="Artificial General Intelligence">AGI</abbr></strong>).

		<h2 id="three">3. Cognitive <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></h2>
		<p>
			Yet another name for human-like <em><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></em> is: <strong>cognitive AI</strong>.
			Todo...

		<h2 id="four">4. Machine Learning</h2>
		<p>
			Todo...
		</p>


		<h2 id="five">5. Why All The Names?</h2>
		<p>
			You might be wondering why I'm spending time listing out all these names.
			The reason is that, after or perhaps even while you are reading this book, you may want to do some further research.
			Knowing these various different names will give you some <em>keyword phrases</em> to search on.
